# Rock Paper Scissors

History:

    Origins
    The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu [zh] by the Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhe [zh] (fl. c. 1600), who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE).[17] In the book, the game was called shoushiling. Li Rihua's book Note of Liuyanzhai also mentions this game, calling it shoushiling (t. 手勢令; s. 手势令), huozhitou (t. 豁指頭; s. 豁指头), or huaquan (划拳).


    Mushi-ken, the earliest Japanese sansukumi-ken game (1809). From left to right: slug (namekuji), frog (kawazu) and snake (hebi).
    From China the game was brought to Japan.[18] Throughout Japanese history there are frequent references to sansukumi-ken, meaning ken (fist) games "of the three who are afraid of one another" (i.e. A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A).[18]

    The earliest sansukumi-ken in Japan was apparently mushi-ken (虫拳), a version imported directly from China.[18][19] In mushi-ken the "frog" (represented by the thumb) triumphs over the "slug" (represented by the little finger), which, in turn prevails over the "snake" (represented by the index finger), which triumphs over the "frog".[18][19] (The Chinese and Japanese versions differ in the animals represented; in adopting the game, the Chinese characters for the venomous centipede (蜈蜙) were apparently confused with the characters for the slug (蛞蝓)).[19]

    The most popular sansukumi-ken game in Japan[when?] was kitsune-ken (狐拳). In this game, a supernatural fox called a kitsune (狐) defeats the village head, the village head (庄屋) defeats the hunter, and the hunter (猟師) defeats the fox. Kitsune-ken, unlike mushi-ken or rock–paper–scissors, requires gestures with both hands.[20]


    Kitsune-ken was a popular Japanese rock paper scissors variant. From left to right: The hunter (ryōshi), village head (shōya) and fox (kitsune).
    Today, the best-known sansukumi-ken is called jan-ken (じゃんけん),[19] which is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century.[21] Jan-ken uses the rock, paper, and scissors signs[18] and is the direct source of the modern version of rock paper scissors.[19] Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper, and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th century, between the Edo and Meiji periods.[22]
